# OneSpec Local Sales Strategy -- New Westminster, BC

## Overview

This document outlines a door-to-door and in-person sales strategy for OneSpec, targeting service businesses in New Westminster and surrounding Metro Vancouver areas. The goal is to sign businesses onto OneSpec's AI-powered appointment reminder system to reduce their no-show rates.

---

## 1. Target Industries (Prioritized)

Focus on businesses where **no-shows directly cost revenue** and appointment volume is high.

### Tier 1 -- Highest Pain, Fastest Close
| Industry | Why They Need OneSpec | Common No-Show Rate |
|---|---|---|
| **Dental clinics** | Each empty chair = $200-500 lost revenue | 10-20% |
| **Medical/walk-in clinics** | Regulatory pressure to reduce wait times | 15-25% |
| **Hair salons & barbershops** | Tight schedules, stylists paid per client | 15-30% |
| **Spas & esthetics** | High-value bookings ($100-300+) | 10-20% |

### Tier 2 -- Strong Fit
| Industry | Why They Need OneSpec |
|---|---|
| **Physiotherapy & chiropractic** | Repeat appointment series, insurance billing complexity |
| **Auto repair & detailing shops** | Booked bays sitting empty hurt margins |
| **Fitness studios & personal trainers** | Class/session no-shows disrupt scheduling |
| **Tattoo studios** | Long sessions, custom prep work wasted on no-shows |
| **Veterinary clinics** | Similar dynamics to medical clinics |

### Tier 3 -- Opportunistic
- Accounting & tax firms (seasonal)
- Tutoring centers
- Immigration consultants
- Real estate brokerages (open house reminders)

## 4. The Sales Pitch

### Opening (at the front desk -- you have 10 seconds)

> "Hi, I'm [Name] from OneSpec. We help [dental clinics / salons / etc.] cut no-shows in half with AI phone reminders. Does your business deal with no-shows?"

**If they say yes** (most will): Move to the pain question.
**If they say no**: "That's great -- most businesses we talk to lose 10-20% of appointments. If that ever changes, here's my card."

### Pain Discovery (60 seconds)

Ask these questions to quantify the problem:

1. "How many appointments do you have per day?"
2. "Roughly how many no-shows do you get per week?"
3. "What does a missed appointment cost you in revenue?"
4. "How do you currently remind patients/clients? Texts? Manual calls?"

**Do the math with them:**
> "So if you're seeing 5 no-shows a week at $150 each, that's $3,000/month in lost revenue. OneSpec costs $49/month and cuts that in half. That's a 30x return."

### Product Demo (2-3 minutes -- use your phone)

1. Open the OneSpec dashboard on your phone/tablet
2. Show how fast setup is (3 minutes)
3. **Play a sample call** -- let them hear the AI voice (this is the wow moment)
4. Show the call transcript feature
5. Emphasize: "It sounds like a real person, not a robot"

### Handle Objections

| Objection | Response |
|---|---|
| "We already send text reminders" | "Texts get a 20-30% open rate. Phone calls get answered 80%+ of the time. OneSpec does what texts can't -- it has a conversation. If someone wants to reschedule, it handles that too." |
| "Our patients are mostly older" | "That's actually our best use case. Older clients prefer phone calls over texts. The AI voice is warm and clear." |
| "We don't have time to set this up" | "Setup takes 3 minutes. I can do it with you right now. You add your appointments, and OneSpec handles the rest." |
| "Sounds expensive" | "It's $49/month for 500 calls. If it prevents even one no-show, it's paid for itself. And you can start free with 50 calls to test it." |
| "I need to talk to the owner/manager" | "Totally understand. Can I leave a one-pager? What's the best time to catch them? I'll come back." |
| "We tried something like this before" | "What didn't work? Most tools send robotic texts. OneSpec makes actual phone calls with AI that sounds human. Want to hear a sample?" |
| "What about privacy / HIPAA?" | "OneSpec is secure by design. Enterprise plans include a HIPAA BAA. We use encrypted infrastructure and your data stays isolated." |

### Close

**Soft close** (if they seem interested but hesitant):
> "Why don't we start you on the free plan -- 50 calls a month, no credit card. You'll see results in the first week. If it works, you can upgrade."

**Direct close** (if they're clearly sold):
> "Let's get you set up right now. It takes 3 minutes. What email do you want to use?"

## 6. Follow-Up System

### Day 2-3

  > "Hey [Name], I noticed you signed up but haven't made your first call yet. Want me to walk you through it? Takes 2 minutes."

### Day 14
- Check in with free-tier users on their results
- Pitch the upgrade to Growth ($49/month) if they've used their 50 calls

### Ongoing
- Monthly check-in with paying customers (retention + referral asks)

## 7. Metrics to Track

| Metric | Daily Target | Weekly Target |
|---|---|---|
| Doors knocked | 30-40 | 150-200 |

| Demos given | 3-5 | 15-25 |
| Free signups | 1-2 | 5-10 |

---

## 8. Pricing Strategy for In-Person Sales

### Lead with Free
Always start with the free tier (50 calls/month). It removes friction and lets the product sell itself.

### Upgrade Path
- **Free -> Growth ($49/mo)**: When they hit 50 calls or want multi-user access
- **Growth -> Enterprise**: When they have multiple locations or need HIPAA BAA

### Potential Local Incentives
- "First month of Growth free if you sign up today" (if authorized to offer)
- "Refer another business owner, get a free month"
- Bundle discount for multi-location businesses

---

## 9. Competitive Positioning

### vs. Text Reminder Systems (Jane App, Cliniko, etc.)
- "We call, we don't text. Calls get answered; texts get ignored."
- "Our AI has a real conversation -- confirms, reschedules, takes notes."

### vs. Manual Front-Desk Calls
- "Your receptionist spends 2 hours a day calling patients. OneSpec does it automatically so they can focus on the people in front of them."

### vs. No Reminder System
- "You're losing $X/month to no-shows. OneSpec costs $49."

## Key Principles

1. **Lead with the problem, not the product.** "Do you deal with no-shows?" is more powerful than "Want to buy our software?"
2. **Demo on the spot.** The AI voice is the selling point. Let them hear it.
3. **Free tier is your foot in the door.** Never leave without at least getting them on free.
4. **Follow up relentlessly.** Most sales happen on the 2nd or 3rd touch.
5. **Ask for referrals.** Every happy customer knows other business owners.
6. **Track everything.** If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.
7. **Dress professionally.** You're selling to business owners. Look the part.
8. **Be respectful of their time.** Front desk staff are busy. Be concise, friendly, and leave if they're slammed -- come back later.
